this is how all STD-GUI program links are formatted:

{
	title = "full-name-of-program",
	url = "url-to-direct-download",
	creator = "name-of-creator",
	description = "brief-description",
	catagory = 1,
	forumPost = "url-to-cc-forum-post",
	keywords = {"beep","boop"},
	run = false
}

here are all the aliases:

std.aliases = {
	ldd = "~f&1LDD&8estroier",
	eldidi = "~f&1Eldidi&8Stroyrr",
	oeed = "~d&0oeed",
	lur = "~b&fLur",
	theoriginalbit = "&ftheoriginal&3bit",
	cloudninja = "~b&0Cloud Ninja",
	run = "&0~dRUN",
	download = "&0~dDOWNLOAD"
}

these are all the category names:

DEFAULT LIST: {
	[1] = "Utility",		-- a general utility
	[2] = "Pocket",			-- tailored specifically for pocket computers
	[3] = "Game",			-- an actual game, not an animation or whatever
	[4] = "Toy",			-- this is where animations and whatnot would go
	[5] = "Operating System",	-- links to an operating system install
	[6] = "Networking",		-- more specific utility that uses modems
	[7] = "Malicious",		-- malicious code is allowed here, but PLEASE label it as such
	[8] = "API",			-- if it doesn't do anything on its own
	[9] = "Turtle",			-- For turtles, using the Turtle API.
	[10] = "Command",		-- If it uses the command API at all
	[11] = "HTTP",			-- If it is centred around HTTP, put it here.
}

CC-MEDIA LIST: {
	[1] = "NBS Music",
