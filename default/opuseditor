	description = "The standard edit program of Opus OS, now standalone. Comes with several new features to make it superior to regular 'edit', such as mouse text selecting, built-in copy/cut/paste, a goto line function, multiple undo, and more standard key shortcuts (hold CTRL, then press C or V or X).\n\nThis is not an installer, so DOWNLOAD all you like.",
